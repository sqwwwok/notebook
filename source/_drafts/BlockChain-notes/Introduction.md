## Traditional currency system

1. Role of Central Banks: Central banks issue fiat currency and use tools like interest rate policies to regulate the economy.
2. Regulation and Compliance: Financial institutions are supervised by government and regulatory bodies to ensure stability and transparency in the financial system.
3. Credit System: The modern monetary system relies on a credit system, where individuals and businesses obtain loans and credit through banks.

It is clear that the traditional monetary system is centered around governments and central banks.

## What is de-centralized
Imagine a system, where everyone can earn currency through a certain amount of labor and freely engage in transactions. In the absence of a central organization, individuals cannot deceive others to obtain currency or fabricate transactions, just like being compelled to adhere to the laws of physics.
